This sample extension is to learn how 'browser actions' work
---------------

Browser actions are used to put icon in 'chrome toolbar'. Brower Action Icon can also have

- Tooltip
- Badge
- Popup 

When user will click on browser action icon, it will show the html page defined in 'popup' property. You may use this popup to show any content or can take input/options from user etc.

This icon will be visible for all pages. If you wnat to use your action for some selective pages, you should use 'page action' instead of browser action.
 'Page action' will be discussed in upcoming demos.
